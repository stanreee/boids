# background
 Boids is an artificial life program developed by Craig Reynolds. The program consists of flying entities, 'boids', that follow three rules:
 * separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
 * alignment: steer towards average heading of local flockmates
 * cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates

 My very simple interpretation of the boid program was created using the Unity game engine in C#.
